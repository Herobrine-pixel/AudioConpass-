# 🎧 AudioCompass

**AudioCompass** is an Arduino-compatible library for **ESP32-S3** boards with **two I2S microphones** that detects the **direction of incoming sound** using a real **TinyML model** and **MFCC feature extraction**.

It outputs one of the four directions:
- `"Front"`
- `"Back"`
- `"Left"`
- `"Right"`

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Dual I2S microphone input (e.g., INMP441)
- ✅ Real-time audio capture & buffering
- ✅ MFCC feature extraction using CMSIS-DSP
- ✅ TinyML model trained on directional audio features
- ✅ TFLite Micro inference on-device (no internet or PC needed)
- ✅ Clean Arduino API: `AudioCompass.getDirection()`
- ✅ Fully compatible with Arduino Library Manager

---

## 🔌 Hardware Required

- 1x **ESP32-S3** board (with I2S support)
- 2x **I2S microphones** (e.g. INMP441)
- Wires & headers

---

## 📦 Installation

1. Download the latest release of `AudioCompass.zip`
2. Open Arduino IDE → **Sketch > Include Library > Add .ZIP Library**
3. Select `AudioCompass.zip`

---

## 📄 Example Sketch

```cpp
#include <AudioCompass.h>

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(115200);
  AudioCompass.begin();
}

void loop() {
  String direction = AudioCompass.getDirection();
  Serial.println("Detected Direction: " + direction);
  delay(500);
}
````

## 🧠 Model Training Process

The included TFLite model was trained using synthetic and real audio captured from a stereo microphone setup. Here's how it was done:

### 🔉 1. Data Collection

* 2x I2S microphones were placed **20–40 cm apart**
* Sounds (e.g., clap, tap, beep) were played from:

  * Front (0°)
  * Left (90°)
  * Right (270°)
  * Back (180°)
* Audio was recorded at **16 kHz**, mono or stereo depending on configuration
* Data was labeled accordingly and split into training/validation

### 📊 2. Feature Extraction

* Extracted **13 MFCCs** per frame
* Window size: 30 ms
* Frame step: 10 ms
* Normalized to 0–1 float range

### 🧠 3. Model Architecture (TensorFlow)

```python
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Input(shape=(N_MFCC,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(16, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(4, activation='softmax')
])
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
```

### 🔁 4. Conversion to TFLite

```bash
tflite_convert \
  --keras_model_file=direction_model.h5 \
  --output_file=direction_model.tflite \
  --optimize \
  --target_ops=TFLITE_BUILTINS_INT8
```

### 🔀 5. Convert to C for Arduino

```bash
xxd -i direction_model.tflite > model_data.h
```

## 🧪 Inference & Output

The function `AudioCompass.getDirection()`:

1. Captures a 1-second buffer from the mics
2. Extracts MFCCs
3. Runs inference on the TFLite Micro model
4. Returns a string: `"Front"`, `"Back"`, `"Left"`, or `"Right"`
